            <h3>How Should Everyday Users Think About Image Usage Online?</h3>
<h2>1. Common User Attitudes and Mistakes with Image Usage</h2>
<h3>Most people don’t consider image security as important as passwords, but common mistakes include:</h3>
<p>Posting personal images publicly on social media without privacy settings.</p>
<p>Using the same profile photo across many platforms, making it easy for scammers to find and impersonate you.</p>
<p>Sharing images that reveal sensitive information (house address, ID cards, travel plans, children’s school, etc.).</p>
<p>Uploading images to random or unsafe sites, which might misuse or resell them.</p>
<p>Downloading images or attachments from unknown sources that may contain malware.</p>
<p>Example:
Emma uploads a vacation photo to Instagram, showing her house number and street. She also uses the same selfie as her profile pic on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.</p>
<h2>2. Risks and Consequences of Poor Image Usage</h2>
<p>Identity Theft and Impersonation:
Scammers can use your images to create fake profiles and trick your friends or family.</p>
<p>Doxxing:
Publicly sharing or leaking personal images can reveal your location, workplace, or private details.</p>
<p>Phishing and Malware:
Downloading or clicking images/attachments from unknown emails or messages can infect your device.</p>
<p>Reputation Damage:
Embarrassing or inappropriate images can be copied, shared, or manipulated out of your control.</p>
<p>Social Engineering:
Criminals can learn about your life, habits, or family from images and use that to guess passwords or answer security questions.</p>
<p>Example:
Emma’s house is burglarized while she’s away because her travel photos revealed she wasn’t home, and her street address was visible.</p>
<h2>3. Practical Steps to Improve Image Usage Security</h2>
<p class="sub-point">a) Use Privacy Settings</p>
<p>Always set social media profiles and albums to private or friends-only if possible.</p>
<p>Review who can see your posts and images.</p>
<p class="sub-point">b) Be Selective with What You Share</p>
<p>Avoid sharing images that include sensitive information (ID cards, plane tickets, location details, children’s schools, etc.).</p>
<p>Remove or blur personal info in images before posting.</p>
<p class="sub-point">c) Vary Profile Images</p>
<p>Use different profile pictures for different accounts.
This makes it harder for attackers to link your online identities.</p>
<p class="sub-point">d) Reverse Image Search</p>
<p>Occasionally use tools like Google Reverse Image Search to see where your photos are appearing online.</p>
<p class="sub-point">e) Think Before You Click or Download</p>
<p>Don’t download images or attachments from suspicious emails or unknown sources—they may contain malware.</p>
<p>Be cautious of links or messages that seem out of character, even if they appear to come from friends.</p>
<p class="sub-point">f) Watermark Important Photos</p>
<p>If you share original work (art, photography), add a visible watermark to discourage theft.</p>
<h2>4. Additional Tips for Safe Online Behavior</h2>
<h3>Spot Suspicious Links and Emails</h3>
<p>Be wary of unexpected emails/messages with images or attachments.</p>
<p>Check the sender address and hover over links before clicking.</p>
<h3>Keep Devices and Software Updated</h3>
<p>Regularly update your phone, computer, browser, and antivirus software to protect against vulnerabilities.</p>
<h3>Manage Account Recovery</h3>
<p>Use secure recovery emails/phone numbers.</p>
<p>Avoid using information visible in your images as answers to security questions (pet’s name, birthday, school, etc.).</p>
<h3>Be Mindful of Metadata</h3>
<p>Photos contain hidden data (“EXIF”), such as GPS location, device info, and time taken.</p>
<p>Remove or edit metadata before sharing photos publicly. Most photo editors and smartphones have this option.</p>
<h2>5. Easy-to-Remember Rules & Checklist</h2>
<h3>Golden Rules</h3>
<h3>Think before you share—Would you want this image seen by strangers?</h3>
<p>Don’t overshare—Limit what you post, and who can see it.</p>
<p>Verify sources before clicking on any image or link.</p>
<p>Regularly check your digital footprint—See where your images appear online.</p>
<p>Update your devices to stay protected.</p>
<h3>Checklist</h3>
<h3>Social media images set to private</h3>
<h3>No sensitive info (location, ID) in public images</h3>
<h3>Different profile photos for different accounts</h3>
<h3>Watermarks added to important content</h3>
<h3>Suspicious messages with images ignored/deleted</h3>
<h3>Metadata stripped from public images</h3>
<h3>Devices and software up to date</h3>
<h3>Real-World Scenario</h3>
<p>Alex receives an email claiming to be from a friend, with a photo attached. He opens the attachment, and his computer is infected with ransomware.</p>
<h3>How Alex Could Have Been Safer:</h3>
<p>Verify with his friend via a separate message before opening the attachment.</p>
<p>Keep antivirus and system software up to date.</p>
<p>Be wary of unexpected or out-of-character messages.</p>
